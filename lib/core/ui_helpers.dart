//*========================== IMP Explanation ========================== *//
  /// This method to calculate the responsive dimension of a widget
  /// according to the screen size and the device pixel ratio
  /// it could be used with determining width or height and Widget or text.
//! Why not using MediaQuery ??????????
//? ===>> As in multiple cases the the widget size to the device pixel ratio will be too small or too large.
//? So we have to calculate the scale factor and limit it with max and min values.
//? STEPS:
//! 1- Determine a break point for each platform
  ///   ======>>> It's determined by approximation according to width only not height. <<<<=======.
  ///   On this BP the base dimension will set.
  ///   Under this BP the base dimension will be multiplied by the scale factor to decrease it.
  ///   Above this BP the base dimension will be multiplied by the scale factor to increase it.
  /// ?===> And to avoid too small or too large dimension we will limit it with [min] and [max] values.
  //! 2- get Scale Factor //? ==> as BP also there is a Scale Factor for each Platform.
  //?    SF = currentScreenSize(from MediaQuery) / BP.
  //! 2- get Responsive Dimension
  ///?    RD = baseDimension * SF
